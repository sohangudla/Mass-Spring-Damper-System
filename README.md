# Mass-Spring-Damper-System

Simulate the movement of masses fixed on springs and dampers according to the given scheme. For a specific type of mechanical system, perform an analysis of the equations of motion, design a simulation scheme model, implement a simulation scheme in MATLAB & Simulink. Next, compile the state space representations for the given mechanical system and carry out the simulation also in the program environment (m-file) using its state space description.

The mechanical system is composed of several masses connected by differently positioned springs or dampers. We consider only relative motion, when a constant force acting from the beginning of time t = 0 causes a relative displacement without considering the weight of individual bodies and parts of the mechanical system. Air resistance is neglected. Perform the analysis of the applied forces only in the direction of the applied force F. Do not consider any possibility of deflection of the bodies in the lateral directions. We start primarily from the movement defined by the specified parameters/coefficients.
